# Long Distance Run Self-Evaluation

## Introduction

Evaluating and Visualizing my exercises, for self improvement. My goal is to provide users insight into my runs through analytics, research, and visualizations. 

### My Run Journey

I started running to lose weight, being 260lbs. This idea came to me after graduating high school in 2010...and I noticed I had a lot of time.

In my first year of running, I completed a Marathon. The two consecutive years thereafter, I ran two half marathons. I had on-and-offs with running, but I still run now, and  it has been great. 

Now, I have the opportunity to combine my running experiences with analytics in this project.

Enjoy!
